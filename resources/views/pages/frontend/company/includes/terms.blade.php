        		products or services on our Service, purchase information such as the products or services purchased, 
        		the dates of purchase and the purchase price.
        	</li>

			<li>

        		content you view, and the products and services you use that we and our third-party providers offer. This information includes:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    	<b>Device Information - </b> we collect information about the devices you use to access our Service, such as hardware settings, 
                    	browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
                    </li>

                    		<li>
                    			cookies that may uniquely identify your browser and collect information about how our visitors interact with our Service, 
                    			as well as help us identify problems such as error messages from certain pages. A cookie is a small file containing a string of 
                    			characters that is sent to your computer or other device when you visit our Service. When you visit our Service any time thereafter, 
                    			the cookie allows our Service to recognize your browser and to store information about your user preferences and other personal information.

                    	such as browser web storage (including HTML 5), which allows for data to be stored on a browser even after the browser has been 
                    	closed and the reopened, and application data caches, which allow for data to be stored on your device, enabling an application 
                    	to run without an Internet connection and to load content faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>

			it can be used by EMI and its various advertisers and other service providers to send you promotions and other 
			communications concerning business opportunities, products or services. You can remove yourself from any such 
			electronic newsletters and otherwise stop receiving any further promotions and other commercial communications

		</li> -->
	</ol>

	<p>
		We may use the name you provide for your INCATTECH Profile across all of the services we offer that require an INCATTECH Account, 
		which is where the information you provide is maintained. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your 
		INCATTECH Account, so that you are represented consistently across all our services.

		We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, , like <em>pixel tags</em>, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. 
		You can reset your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. But you need to know that you may not be able to

		We do not track our users across third party websites and thus do not respond to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals. 
		However, some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. 
		If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) 
		know you do not want to be tracked.

<section id="advertising">
    <h2 class="title" style="text-align: justify;">3. The Advertising on Our Service.</h2>
    <p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
			Advertising on our Service makes it possible for us to offer you the information and products/services free of charge. 
			We take seriously and make every effort to make sure that advertising is safe, unobtrusive and as relevant as possible.
		</p>

		<p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
			Cookies are used to make that advertising as relevant as possible to the needs and interests of users of our Service, 
			and more valuable to our advertisers in being able to show our visitors more relevant ads. Cookies are also used to 
			avoid you seeing the same ad multiple times and to detect and prevent click fraud. We use AdSense, Google Analytics 
			and other DoubleClick services (collectively, "Google® Services"), which help us manage and improve our Service and 
			help our advertisers better understand and track user interaction with their ads. When you visit a location on our 
			Service that includes one or more of these ads, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
		</p>

		<p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
			We may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, which provide the functionality for such displays as 
			interactive advertising. We may also use your IP address to select and provide advertising targeted to that address, 
			in order to improve the relevance of the ads you see and to measure and report to advertisers non-personal statistical 
			information about geographical location of those website visitors who are viewing their ads.
		</p>

		<p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
			The advertisment you see on our Service is determined by a number of factors relating to relevance, 
			including 
			<ol>
				<li>
					Your approximate geographical location base on you IP address, and
				</li>

				<li>
					The subject matter you may be viewing on our Service.
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			For example, if you are viewing an article about Digital health, you may see ads concerning exercise equipment.
		</p> 

		<!-- <p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
			If you wish to know more about the information collected from website users and used to tailor those advertisements 
			for products and services which might be of the most interest and relevance to those users, or would like to know 
			more about the user’s options in connection with the collection and use of that information, 
			you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">

    <h2 class="title">4. Privacy and Choice.</h2>
    
    <p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
		People have different concerns about privacy. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, 
		so that you can make meaningful choices about how that information is used. You may set your browser in 
		its "options" or "preferences" feature in order to warn you before accepting cookies or to disable all 
		cookies entirely. However, it is important to understand that many of the services we provide on our 
		Service and to our Service users may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

		INCATTECH does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 
		or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our Service. No one under age 16 is allowed to provide any 
		personal information to EMI or on our Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal 
		information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

    <h2 class="title">6. Where We Store the Information</h2>
    
    <p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">
		The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of your 
		country and the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>") including, in particular, the United States. 
		It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

<section id="infoshare">
    <h2 class="title">7. The Information You Share.</h2>
    <p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">Our Service allows visitors to share information with others, such as comments on editorial content and information shared via social media. When you share information it may as a result become accessible to others, through such mechanisms as search engines.

<section id="updateinfo">
	<h2 class="title">8. Updating Your Personal Information.</h2>
	<p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">It is our policy that, whenever you visit our Service, you should be able to access your <em>personal information</em>, which is information identifying you such as name, email address, billing information or any other information which can reasonably be expected to identify you. If that information is incorrect, we try to provide you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes, in which case it will be retained for the periods specified in this Privacy Policy. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
	<p class="fifteen" style="text-align: justify;">If allowed under applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, requests which would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems)).</p>
	<p class="fifteen"style="text-align: justify;">Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so at no cost to you, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Service, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
